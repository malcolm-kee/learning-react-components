## About This Workshop

Learn to create reusable React components and create an interactive styleguide to share with other developers and team members.

---

## Key Learning Goals

- Good practices while writing React components
- Learn React hooks

---

## Why create React components?

- makes your developement easier/faster
- makes your UI more consistent
- minimize surface area of 3rd party dependency
- makes your site more accessible if the base components are accessible.

---

## [Why Accessibility Matters](https://twitter.com/Microsoft/status/1090973098218668032)

Why I care, and why I hope you care too.

---

## Format

- Show you how to do
- Do it by following what I did
- Do it yourself with different example
- You ask question/share what you've learnt
- Outline of the exercises are listed [here](https://github.com/malcolm-kee/learning-react-components/blob/master/README.md).

---

## Project

Refactoring [an eCommerce site](https://react-ecomm.netlify.com/).

- the site is developed with React and Redux
- we will refactor the React codes while learning
- develop a [component docs site](https://react-ecomm-docs.netlify.com/) at the end.
- I will not explain about the Redux code but it should not be relevant

### Demo 1a: <br />Creating `Button` component wrapping `button`.

### Demo 1b: <br />Creating `Textare` component wrapping `textarea`.

---

### Exercise 1b: <br />Creating `Input` component wrapping `input`.

---

### Section 1 Takeaways (1/2):

When creating a wrapper:

1. design your props and prop defaults based on use cases; **write same code twice**.
2. using spread operators to pass down supported props

---

### Section 1 Takeaways (2/2):

3. merge the props or use a different props name (`classnames` and `callAll` are useful here).
4. use `prop-types` to document your component.
